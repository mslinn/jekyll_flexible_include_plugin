# Instructions

Resolve environment variable `agent_instructions` then read `bootstrap.md` from
that directory. If you have trouble understanding this instruction, or any
subsequent instruction, STOP and ask for help.

After reading bootstrap.md, read `$agent_instructions/index.md` for general
instructions.

## Project Context

This is the `jekyll_flexible_include_plugin`, which provides flexible include
functionality for Jekyll sites with variable substitution and conditional
rendering capabilities.

See `$agent_instructions/ruby_standards.md` for Ruby and Jekyll coding
instructions.
